This is a descriptive placeholder for the framework diagram (Figure 1) to be created in a graphics program.

The diagram should illustrate the following components of the gene-disease association prediction framework:

1. INPUT:
   - Gene-Disease Association Graph (bipartite graph with genes and diseases as nodes)
   - Each node labeled with its type (gene/disease)
   - Existing associations shown as edges

2. DATA PREPARATION:
   - Graph splitting into train/validation/test sets
   - Negative sampling process
   - Optional: creation of smaller subgraphs for efficient experimentation

3. MODEL ARCHITECTURES (showing the four main GNN variants):
   - GCN: Illustrate the graph convolution operation
   - GAT: Show attention mechanism between nodes
   - GraphSAGE: Depict the sample-and-aggregate approach
   - SEAL: Show how enclosing subgraphs are extracted around target links

4. TRAINING PROCESS:
   - Loss function visualization
   - Validation on held-out edges
   - Model selection based on validation performance

5. LINK PREDICTION:
   - Application of trained model to predict new gene-disease associations
   - Ranking of predicted associations by confidence score

6. EVALUATION:
   - Performance metrics (AUC, AP, F1, etc.)
   - Comparison visualization between different models

Suggested visual style:
- Use a left-to-right flow to show the full pipeline
- Use distinct colors for genes and diseases
- Use dashed lines for predicted associations
- Include small graphs illustrating how each GNN operates on the same example
- Add a magnified view of subgraphs to show model operations in detail
